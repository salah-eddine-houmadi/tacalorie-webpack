Troubleshooting Tips
Webpack Configuration: Make sure your webpack.config.js file is correctly set up to handle your app’s assets, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.
Dev Server Issues: If the development server fails to start on localhost:3000, ensure that nothing else is using that port, or update the configuration to use a different port in webpack.config.js.
